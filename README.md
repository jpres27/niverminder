# niverminder

Niverminder is an application developed by Cesar Montalverne and John Presley in React Native using Expo. It allows users to create a list of contacts, add birthdays for those contacts, and then schedule push notifications.
Each push notification should then take the user to a screen to allow them to send a form text wishing the contact a happy birthday.

The app was originally conceived as scheduling automated text messages to be sent out but this appears to be impossible to adequately implement with Expo and React Native.
