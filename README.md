# niverminder

Niverminder is an application which allows users to create a list of contacts, add birthdays for those contacts, and then schedule push notifications.
Each push notification should then take the user to a screen to allow them to send a form text wishing the contact a happy birthday. It is developed in React Native using Expo.

The app was originally conceived as scheduling automated text messages to be sent out but this appears to be impossible to adequately implement with Expo and React Native.
