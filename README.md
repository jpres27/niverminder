# niverminder

Niverminder is an application which allows users to create a list of contacts, add birthdays for those contacts, and then schedule push notifications.
Each push notification should then take the user to a screen to allow them to send a form text wishing the contact a happy birthday. It is developed in React Native using Expo.
